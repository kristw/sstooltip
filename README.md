sstooltip
=========

This is a simple &amp; stupid tooltip javascript library, but that's probably exactly what you need.

Features
- Smart tooltip placement: It will try to place the tooltip at the suitable position (avoid falling of the screen.)
- Lightweight: Only 3KB (2KB js + 1KB css)

Only requires jQuery. See [demo](http://kristw.github.io/sstooltip)

For AngularJS support, check out [angular-sstooltip](https://github.com/kristw/angular-sstooltip)

(For sstooltip version 3.2 and lower, angular-sstooltip is included when you install sstooltip. The code have been separated into two repositories since version 4.0.)
