This is a simple &amp; stupid tooltip javascript library.

Features
- Smart tooltip placement: It will try to place the tooltip at the suitable position (avoid falling of the screen.)
- Lightweight: Only 3KB (2KB js + 1KB css) plus addition 3KB for angularjs support
- Supports angularjs: Comes with directive `sstooltip` and service `sstooltipManager`

Only requires jQuery. See [demo](http://kristw.github.io/sstooltip)
